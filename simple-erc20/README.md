# Simple ERC20 risc0 example

Welcome to the simple ERC20 risc0 example, this is a simple contract to get started with.

## Quick Start

First, make sure [rustup] is installed. The
[`rust-toolchain.toml`][rust-toolchain] file will be used by `cargo` to
automatically install the correct version.

To build all methods and register the smart contract on the local node, run:
```bash
cargo run -- register 1000
```
On the node's logs, you should see a line like 

> 📝 Registering new contract simple_token

To send a blob & proof transactions to send 2 token to *bob* you can run:
```bash
cargo run -- transfer faucet.simple_token bob.simple_token 2
```

This will 
- send a Blob transaction to transfer 2 token from faucet to bob
- Generate a zk proof
- Send the proof 

The node will 
- verify the proof 
- settle the blob transaction
- Update the contract state 

Note: The example does not compose with an identity contract, thus no identity verification is made. 
This is the reason of the suffix ".simple_token" on the "from" & "to" transfer fields. More info to come in the documentation.

### Executing the Project Locally in Development Mode

During development, faster iteration upon code changes can be achieved by leveraging [dev-mode], we strongly suggest activating it during your early development phase. Furthermore, you might want to get insights into the execution statistics of your project, and this can be achieved by specifying the environment variable `RUST_LOG="[executor]=info"` before running your project.

Put together, the command to run your project in development mode while getting execution statistics is:

```bash
RUST_LOG="[executor]=info" RISC0_DEV_MODE=1 cargo run
```

<!--### Running Proofs Remotely on Bonsai-->

<!--_Note: The Bonsai proving service is still in early Alpha; an API key is-->
<!--required for access. [Click here to request access][bonsai access]._-->
<!---->
<!--If you have access to the URL and API key to Bonsai you can run your proofs-->
<!--remotely. To prove in Bonsai mode, invoke `cargo run` with two additional-->
<!--environment variables:-->
<!---->
<!--```bash-->
<!--BONSAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" BONSAI_API_URL="BONSAI_URL" cargo run-->
<!--```-->

## How to create a project based on this example 

- The [RISC Zero Developer Docs][dev-docs] is a great place to get started.
- Example projects are available in the [examples folder][examples] of
  [`risc0`][risc0-repo] repository.
- Reference documentation is available at [https://docs.rs][docs.rs], including
  [`risc0-zkvm`][risc0-zkvm], [`cargo-risczero`][cargo-risczero],
  [`risc0-build`][risc0-build], and [others][crates].

## Directory Structure

It is possible to organize the files for these components in various ways.
However, in this starter template we use a standard directory structure for zkVM
applications, which we think is a good starting point for your applications.
