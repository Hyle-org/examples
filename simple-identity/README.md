# Simple Identity risc0 example

On Hyl√©, any smart contract can serve as proof of identity. This flexibility allows you to register your preferred identity source as a smart contract for account identification. Hyl√© also ships [a native `hydentity` contract](https://github.com/Hyle-org/hyle/tree/main/contracts/hydentity) for simplicity.

This is a Risc0 example called simple_identity.

## Prerequisites

- [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (you'll need `rustup` and Cargo).
- For our example, [install RISC Zero](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/install).
- [Start a single-node devnet](https://docs.hyle.eu/developers/quickstart/devnet/). We recommend using [dev-mode](https://dev.risczero.com/api/generating-proofs/dev-mode) with `-e RISC0_DEV_MODE=1` for faster iterations during development.

## Quickstart

### Build and register the identity contract

To build all methods and register the smart contract on the local node [from the source](https://github.com/Hyle-org/examples/blob/simple_erc20/simple-token/host/src/main.rs), run:

```bash
cargo run -- register-contract
```

The expected output is `üìù Registering new contract simple_identity`.

### Register an account / Sign up

To register an account with a username (`alice`) and password (`abc123`), execute:

```sh
cargo run -- register-identity alice.simple_identity abc123
```

The node's logs will display:

```bash
INFO hyle_verifiers: ‚úÖ Risc0 proof verified.
```

### Verify identity / Login

To verify `alice`'s identity:

```bash
cargo run -- verify-identity alice.simple_identity abc123 0
```

This command will:

1. Send a blob transaction to verify `alice`'s identity.
1. Generate a ZK proof of that identity. It will only be valid once, thus the inclusion of a nonce.
1. Send the proof to the devnet.

Upon reception of the proof, the node will:

1. Verify the proof.
1. Settle the blob transaction.
1. Update the contract's state.

The node's logs will display:

```bash
INFO hyle_verifiers: ‚úÖ Risc0 proof verified.
```

### Executing the Project Locally in Development Mode

During development, faster iteration upon code changes can be achieved by leveraging [dev-mode], we strongly suggest activating it during your early development phase. Furthermore, you might want to get insights into the execution statistics of your project, and this can be achieved by specifying the environment variable `RUST_LOG="[executor]=info"` before running your project.

Put together, the command to run your project in development mode while getting execution statistics is:

```bash
RUST_LOG="[executor]=info" RISC0_DEV_MODE=1 cargo run
```

## How to create a project based on this example

- The [RISC Zero Developer Docs][dev-docs] is a great place to get started.
- Example projects are available in the [examples folder][examples] of
  [`risc0`][risc0-repo] repository.
- Reference documentation is available at [https://docs.rs][docs.rs], including
  [`risc0-zkvm`][risc0-zkvm], [`cargo-risczero`][cargo-risczero],
  [`risc0-build`][risc0-build], and [others][crates].

## Directory Structure

It is possible to organize the files for these components in various ways.
However, in this starter template we use a standard directory structure for zkVM
applications, which we think is a good starting point for your applications.
