# Hylé examples

This repository is a collection of examples of contracts and programs that can be deployed and used on Hylé.

Hylé does not have a native execution environment. Smart contracts do not execute code on Hylé; they describe a verification logic for a particular program.

See the [documentation](https://docs.hyle.eu/developers/quickstart/) to learn more.
